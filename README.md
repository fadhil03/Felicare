Felicare
==
Felicare is an application to detect cat diseases by knowing the symptoms and providing solutions for their treatment. Users will fill in several questions from the form according to their cat's symptoms, then the diagnosis results will be displayed.

Felicare is currently under development. Some changes will be updated (such as database schema modifications and machine learning models).
